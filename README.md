## What is OpenGG
OpenGG engine is a world class 3D engine designed for optimal efficiancy and performance.
Because of this, we have decided to use Java as a language of choice. This engine 
technical achievements are unparrelled and are best expierianced if viewed in 1970.
We are already are better than Bethasda's GameByro and creation engines in terms of 
performance. Our framerates are comparable to the Witcher 2 on ubersampling mode.

## Lore
### OBJLoader2
One year ago OBJLoader2 was released to the world in all its glory and forever changed the 
the way people designed model loaders. With innovative methods like FastInt and unique uses of 
interfaces, this loader was really in a tier by itself. While originally shunned by disgruntled 
developers like javster101 who said quotes like "What  is IMTLLimitingScanner" and "How the
hell ddo you not know how to use the thing you commited", OBJLoader2 is now viewed as the forefather 
of OpenGG model loading and ushered the additions of DrawnObjectGroup and MatDrawnObject. So on this
day we celebrate the "commitment" of the developers who work on Opengg and the damn pull problems that
happened on this fine day.
